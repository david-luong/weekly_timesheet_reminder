Randomised Weekly Reminder

Fun little project of mine 💻 

Over time, as someone who shares responsibility to make a weekly reminder for employees to submit their timesheet, I have realised that automated reminders via email are quite ineffective 😞 

Maybe because they are so autonomous that we lose the human feeling to them 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 

However, when we are reminded by a human on the other side, we can empathise that this is something that needs to be done and energy is being expended to do so 🔋 

This might not be the biggest problem in the world, however, it reminds us that we're human ✋ 

To not lose the personal touch, I have created a python program which automatically creates phrases such as: 
"Hey everyone, weekly reminder to submit your timesheets! 😃"
and automatically mix things up each time it is run!

If you haven't realised already, I am a big emoji user 😆
