# weekly_timesheet_reminder
Randomised Weekly Reminder
To not lose the personal touch, I have created a python program which automatically creates phrases such as: 
"Hey everyone, weekly reminder to submit your timesheets! ğŸ˜ƒ"
And automatically mix things up each time it is run!
If you haven't realised already, I am a big emoji user ğŸ˜†
